AVRMIDI-CV
==========

This is my attempt to implement a MIDI-CV-Converter using a Atmel ATMEGA 8 microprocessor.

I started this project as I was in need of a MIDI to CV Converter for my crOwBX 4 Voice Synthesizer (see www.cs80.com/crowbx/). I did not want to buy one and therefor naturally am now building my own.
It is not yet finished - no warranty at all what so ever for it even to just compile now :-) .
