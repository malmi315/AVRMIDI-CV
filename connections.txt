12V from 5V power supply
those 12V feed all the doubling OpAmps
the doubling OpAmps are realized connecting one inlet to the output of the DAC and the other via an adjustable 10KOhm 25-turn resistor, Ground and a 5 KOhm resistor to the output of the OpAmp
there are 4 KeyCV outputs needed from the DAC and 4 Velocity outputs - makes 8 DAC-Outputs
PB - 0 - 7  = 8 Pins
PC - 0 - 6  = 7 Pins
PD - 0 - 7  = 8 Pins
-2 Pins (XTAL)
-4 Pins (SPI)
-2 Pins (DAC)
-2 Pins (UART - MIDI)
-1 Pin	(RESET)
= 12 Pins left
4 Pins (Gate)
4 Pins (Trigger) 
= 4 Pins left

switchable GATE-/TRIGGER-Voltages via jumper and OpAmp

would be nice:
	7 segment display for midi channel
	button to cycle through midi channels (1 Pin) - hardware debouncing!
	7 segment display for operating mode
	poti for portamento (1 Pin)

would be easy:
	power LED

other implementations:
	arpeggiator - not neccessary... will be done by the DAW (would also need MIDI-Clock and stuff)
	protamento - not neccessary... will be done by the synth (would be difficult to implement efficiently but is easy for the synth)
	variable midi-channel - might be considerable :)

Multiswitch for modes:
	8 modes - 3 bit;
