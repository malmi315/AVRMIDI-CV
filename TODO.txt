- add 12V from 5V and OpAmp-Circuits
	- those 12V feed all the doubling OpAmps
	- the doubling OpAmps are realized connecting one inlet to the output of the DAC and the other via an adjustable 10KOhm 25-turn resistor, Ground and a 5 KOhm resistor to the output of the OpAmp
	- there are 4 KeyCV outputs needed from the DAC and 4 Velocity outputs - makes 8 DAC-Outputs
	- check whether 15V works better

- switchable GATE-/TRIGGER-Voltages via jumper and OpAmp

IDEAS
=====
- would be nice:
	- have some soft LFOs instead of velocity outputs (different rates - MIDI clock synced and not)
	- have some general CV instead of velocity outputs (includes MIDI learn)
	- multiswitch or simillar to set the midi channel
	- 7 segment display for midi channel
	- poti for portamento (1 Pin)

- would be easy:
	- power LED

- other implementations:
	- arpeggiator - not neccessary... will be done by the DAW (would also need MIDI-Clock and stuff)
	- protamento - not neccessary... will be done by the synth (would be difficult to implement efficiently but is easy for the synth)
